# Sales-Data-Analysis
This project focusses on analyzing the sales in different regions using a comprehensive Kaggle Superstore dataset. The objective is to identify which products were sold the most, which regions or customer segments are most profitable and what are the monthly/seasonal trends in sales and profit.

Objectives
Sales by Category: Examine the total sales over different products
Profit by Region: Calculate the total profit over different regions such as North,South,East and West region
Top 10 Products : Investigate Top 10 products sold
Sales over Time :Identify monthly sales trend

Methodology
1. Data Preparation: 
    Cleaned the dataset by check the missing values,removed the duplicates, fixed the data types, removed outliers to check extreme values in Sales or Profit.
 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Initially I analyzed the sales and profit data by generating summary statistics, including totals, averages, and distribution metrics. The results offered a comprehensive view of financial performance across
    products and periods.
    To obtain the top-selling products, I calculated total sales by product to evaluate performance across the product portfolio. The highest-revenue product was identified by ranking products based on their
    aggregated sales totals.
    To investigate profit by region, I calculated total and average profit for each region to compare financial performance across markets. This helped identify which regions generated the highest profitability and
    which underperformed.
    To identify sales trend over time, I calculated total sales by month to visualize sales trends over time. This analysis highlighted seasonal patterns, spikes in demand, and months with lower performance.
